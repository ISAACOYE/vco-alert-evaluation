Evaluation of a CDS system for Virtual Constant Observation (VCO) alerts at NYU Langone
**# VCO Alert System Evaluation – NYU Langone

This project presents a structured evaluation of the Virtual Constant Observation (VCO) clinical decision support (CDS) alert system used at NYU Langone.

## Project Overview

The VCO system is designed to identify patients at high risk of adverse events (e.g., falls, cognitive impairment) and recommend constant observation. This analysis was conducted using a combination of structured alert data and unstructured provider feedback.

## Data Sources

- 183,246 VCO alert records
- 324 provider feedback entries
- System interface documentation

## Methodology

- Quantitative analysis of alert burden, departmental patterns, and provider response behavior
- Text analysis and natural language processing (NLP) of clinical reasoning and feedback
- Sentiment analysis of provider comments

## Key Findings

- 78.7% of alerts resulted in “Eligible – Not needed” outcomes, suggesting over-alerting
- Emergency and Medicine departments had the highest true-positive alert rates
- Providers frequently cited issues with alert options, system usability, and clinical workflow misalignment
- Sentiment analysis revealed 61% positive vs. 39% negative feedback

## Recommendations

- Refine alert criteria based on department-level trends
- Improve interface usability (e.g., more acknowledgment options, better layout)
- Standardize VCO availability and CDS implementation across facilities
- Provide clearer clinical guidance and better training on VCO usage

## Deliverables

- Full report presented to NYU Langone Informatics leadership including figures, breakdowns, and recommendations

## Status

Complete. This project was part of a formal evaluation initiative at NYU focused on clinical decision support systems.
